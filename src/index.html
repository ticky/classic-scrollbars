    <h1>Scrollbars of the Classic Mac OS</h1>
    <div class="overscroll classic-mono-scrollbars">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>System 1 through 6 Scrollbars</h2>
        <p>(Note: Non-proportional scroll area indicator is not possible)</p>
        <p>The original Macintosh scrollbars didn't have any colour, and the arrows in the buttons all touched a side.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="overscroll classic-colour-scrollbars">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>System 7 Scrollbars</h2>
        <p>(Note: Non-proportional scroll area indicator is not possible)</p>
        <p>System 7's scrollbars added a dash of colour, some of which even made it through to Platinum!</p>
      </div>

    <div class="overscroll platinum-scrollbars">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Platinum (Mac OS) Scrollbars</h2>
        <p>(Note: The Platinum scrollbars are missing the shadow under the draggable area, and OS 8's scrollbars weren't proportional)</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>All of this is just using (WebKit-specific; sorry, Firefox users!) CSS. No images here whatsoever!</p>
    <p>(You probably wouldn't want to use CSS only for this for a real site, though, but this was a fun exercise!)</p>
